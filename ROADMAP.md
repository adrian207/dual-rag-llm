## How to Contribute to Roadmap

1. **Propose Features**: Open a GitHub issue with `[Feature Request]` label
2. **Vote on Features**: React with üëç on issues you want prioritized
3. **Contribute**: Pick items from roadmap and submit PRs
4. **Discuss**: Join discussions on priorities and implementation

## Priority System

- **P0**: Critical for next release
- **P1**: Important, planned for specific version
- **P2**: Nice to have, not scheduled
- **P3**: Experimental, needs validation

## Success Metrics

We'll measure success by:
- Query latency (target: < 5s average)
- Answer accuracy (target: > 90% helpful)
- System uptime (target: 99.9%)
- User satisfaction scores
- Community engagement (GitHub stars, PRs)

---

**Note:** This roadmap is flexible and will evolve based on:
- Community feedback
- User needs
- Technical feasibility
- Resource availability
